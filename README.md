## Project Objective:
Build a model to predict house prices based on various explanatory variables using advanced regression techniques in Python

## About data:
79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa
1. train.csv - the training set
2. test.csv - the test set

## Learning objectives and methodology:
1. Apply hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation with different regression methods to improve your predictions
2. Perform ensemble predictions (one-layer stacking) by combining predictions from some of the better performing algorithms
3. Handle missing data
